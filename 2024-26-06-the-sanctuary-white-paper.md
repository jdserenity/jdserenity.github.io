### The world needs a new direction. I aim to give it one.

At least I aim to give it an option.

In our modern multicultural societies. We’ve made a huge tradeoff. We’ve gained a rich cultural diversity that exemplifies tolerance and common decency, which is a beautiful achievement. But with it, comes a pervasive tension between groups, constant divisions between ourselves, and an ever present, ever growing threat of conflict, fuelled by hate for “the other”.

### But we’re all human, and there is no other. So why have we forgotten this in such a supposedly modern and sophisticated age?

The answer: lies in that one word that towers over so many others, morality. In my perception, I see the natural tendency for fragmentation playing out throughout our societies. People with the same backgrounds tend to stick together, people with the same beliefs tend to stick together, and people with the same shared history tend to stick together.

We would expect that after a sufficient period of time, differing groups would converge over their shared humanity and continued understanding of each other. But the reality is, that at the core of all belief systems, there are very important decisions made about morality. And when one group thinks the other is being sufficiently immoral (i.e. causing undue harm, disrespecting their perception of god, taking away the freedoms they previously were allowed, etc.), most people will not stand for such a thing.

Because morality also lies at the very thing that gives us any meaning in life, or any purpose for doing anything, this creates a dark abyss of conflict between groups. Each group must play out their moral code, or have no meaning. But one group’s moral code, will inevitably go strongly against another's.

### I believe that some of you will agree with this perception. And I hope that some of you will agree with my proposed solution.

Religion and philosophy are two sides of the same coin. Humanity’s quest to answer the most fundamental, most pressing, and most important questions that we are faced with in life. You know the ones. Because all humans are faced with these same questions, and no humans can function without satisfying answers to these questions, these questions must be answered. And every culture since the beginning of cultures has taken their best shot at it.

The result is that we now find ourselves with an extremely deep tapestry of every culture’s attempted answers. From heaven and hell, to nirvana, to void. 

### What should we do with our time? Well, there are many answers to that. What is good and what is evil? Well, it’s not that simple.

### With so many answers, and so many of them conflicting, we become lost. This happened to me, and it may have happened to you.

The thing is though, that the way truth works, is there can only be one of it. And although we may never find it, I believe we can find sufficient meaning in the everlasting pursuit of it. I think that that in itself is enough to keep us going, and to keep us all going, together. As a team. I dream of a world with no more warring factions. And No More Divisions.

The Sanctuary is a place where one can go to ask questions about these deepest of topics. It is a place where one can go to connect with others who also struggle with these questions. And it is a place where civil discourse between opposing viewpoints, will systematically, and finally, allow us to arrive where we need to be. Peace.

My first idea is that we can get together, maybe read from one of the many good religious or philosophical texts we can find, and then have a group discussion about what we learned, or what is on our minds, or whatever else. We can critically analyze ours and each other’s thoughts, and seek the truth together. Then we can have a brief session of being social to allow for companionship and bonds to be formed. 30 minutes for each thing, 1 hour and a half in total.

Maybe I’ll create a separate study group or what was commonly know as a “youth group” if enough people are interested and want to dive deep. 

Of course this is just my first proposal, and as we go along, with the help of all participants, we can change and improve things as we see fit. Slowly moving closer to our goal. And of course, Sunday has traditionally been a day for this sort of thing for some cultures, and within our own culture I think it serves as a good day as well.

I think that church as an institution served an incredible value that we have lost as a society, and that we need not believe in any current faith to be able to take part in that value. We can have a place of discussion, a place where people take shelter from the pain of life, and a place where people can form bonds with each other on the basis of their shared grappling with everything that it means to be alive.

So that being said: all are welcomed. The only way to get to the truth is to debate all possible perspectives. So Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, etc. All are welcomed here. Gays, straights, blacks, whites, “progressives”, “conservatives”, there are too many of us to list here. But. all. are. welcomed. here.

Just be prepared to have your opinions pushed back on and dissected. And be prepared to hear views about the world that may not be what you want to hear. They exist and the only way to improve them is to bring them to light. Just know that no falsehoods will be allowed to stand.

## DISCLAIMER: If anyone becomes physically violent you will be asked to leave. Only civil discourse is allowed.

My hope is not that this idea will be successful, and not even that this group will be successful. My hope is that others will be inspired by this experiment, learn from what we discover, and continue growing a movement towards unity, and towards peace. This may not be the best option that has ever existed or that will ever exist. It may even be a terrible idea. But at least it’s an idea, and unfortunately I don’t see very many of those right now.

The Sanctuary will be taking place every Sunday at 11am for 1 hour and a half. Join me if you like, it would be my pleasure.

sanctuary
noun
1. a place of refuge or safety.





### I watched the Barbie movie. I thought it was great.

I don't really like movies, I rarely watch them. My favourite movies are Inside Out and Instant Family. That should tell you a lot about me. I don't like being entertained and movies are for the most part a whole lot of that. As far as entertainment goes, barbie was run of the mill. Exposition, conflict, climax, denouement. Rinse and repeat. It got boring and I wanted to do something more valuable with my time, my experience with most movies, whatever. But I did leave my illegally streamed movie theater cam recording session with gratitude at the predicted impact this movie will have on culture. And <em><strong>that</strong></em> is why I thought it was great.

America is the only place in the world that this movie could have ever been created. The freest nation in the history of nations. It could have only been there. I would like to have an american passport for exactly this reason (citizenship by investment ftw), even if it's not my first choice of residence. I was commenting this to my friend Cadin, nowhere else in the world could this movie have been not just created, but experienced by so many minds. ($1B box office milestone reached as of yesterday (2023 dollars)). That's something to be in awe of. Even if america is declining, which I am currently leaning towards believing is the case, its immense beauty, power, and ability to think has to be appreciated.

#### <strong>I'm now going to give my thoughts on the movie, if you don't want spoilers, stop reading now.</strong>

I'll start by acknowledging that I felt personally attacked by the depiction of Ken. Haha, obviously right! It was hard for me to have a mirror held up to my life, especially of the first stage of Ken where he can best be described as a simp, (we will <em>simply</em> call him Simp Ken) and less so, but still, by the second stage of Ken which we will call Insecure Alpha Ken (or IAK). I've never been the guy that gets cute girls, I've never been the popular guy, so to see Simp Ken first of all portrayed so parodically and second of all dismissed so easily by Barbie and her friends, shined a light on one of my deepest insecurities. Luckily I'm a gigachad and this didn't stop me from continuing to watch the film. (should we even call movies films any more? or for that matter movies?) (seems to me like movies are just a style of video at this point in history. Music video, vlog, video essay, long form story video with soundstrack, haha.)

However, I recognize that the various stages of Ken are a large part of what women deal with every day of their lives. It seems like the creators wanted to tell the truth as they saw it, and I'm grateful that they didn't hold back. To be more precise, Barbie The Movie, let me see the world through the eyes of women in a way I have never had the opportunity to. I've recently started getting really into Empathy, so this was thoroughly enjoyable for me. As I was watching the long video, I found myself wanting to help create a world where girls have the maximal opportunity to be whoever they want to be. This was already part of my life goal, but it definetely made me want to do it more. I expect that to be the case for men all around the world, and even if they don't go that far and the film helped them only in increasing their understanding of women, this is a huge win.

So here I will give you something to think about: How can we create a world where women are given the most amount of freedom and resources possible to be who they want to be? Are there any downsides to freedom we should reflect on?

Feel free to reach out to me with some ideas if you'd like to.

Continuing on, I really enjoy the concept of empathy. To me, empathy can also be described as: one's ability to accurately model another conscious being's experience. The better one can model, the higher their empathy. The fantastic thing is, this means empathy is an increasable skill. And if we can increase a skill, then we can create technologies to scale that increase optimally. I want that to be part of my life mission. I think that creating empathy increasing technologies is probably one of the most important things we can do at this point in history. For human - human coordination/alignment, for human - ai coordination/alignment, and whatever other conscious beings are added into the mix in the coming future, it seems to me an essentiality of creating a future that is good. The more empathy we have, the better the decisions we will make, and decisions are all that matter in this life.

I really like the idea of the neuralink and brain machine interfaces. I am theorizing that it is possible to digitally model and render our own awarenesses, have all of our memories stored, as well as the way we experience those memories, the way we understand the world, what words mean to us, what actions mean to us, etc. Everything that we could classify as making a person different from another person. If this is truly possible, and it seems we will find out in the next 10-15 years, then I am hoping it will be possible to be able to package that into an experiencable experience. Like a 4d immersive video. Maybe you fully become that person for a couple minutes or hours, or maybe there is a less immersive option where you are just observing but your understanding has increased by orders of magnitude. You can replay scenes you'd like to better understand, you can share or upload your own. Who knows what it will look like. I'm not sure. Maybe there is a great way to increase empathy that doesn't require us to wait 10 years and is less complex. Let's make this a point of focus and iterate forward.

So here's another prompt: How can we create technologies to maximally increase our empathy individually and thus collectively? What is the optimal route to get there? Are there any downsides to empathy we should reflect on?

To be clear, my current position on the predominantly american experimentation of gender roles and identity, is that humans are evolving before our very eyes. And just like natural selection creates branching pathways of species, so too is this new culture a branching pathway of human. I do not believe it is the only possible evolution of human, but the way our systems are organized at the moment makes it very hard for anything but homogenous cultures to exist, and this one has been competetively advantageous for a good while now. One of my most important life aims is to help create societal systems that allow for the proliferation and expansion of the diverse possibilities in which humans may evolve. 

So maybe this movie is actually harmful in that it only serves to create a more homogenous culture with respect to "wokeness". I don't think so as I can see how it would be more thought provoking than brainwashing, but I could be wrong. Maybe I only decided to like it because I would be ostracized from my friend groups if i didn't. I don't think so either because I'm not the most agreeable person and I have a very deep sense of dignity through truth seeking. But again, I could be wrong. I truly hope that the movie is having the positive effects I think it's having on the world and that it is a net good for humanity, either way, we march on.

Before I finish, I want to leave you with one last prompt. One of the main critiques I had of the movie is that the creators developed two depictions of what men shouldn't be, in a way that I felt like was tearing us down. Simp Ken and Insecure Alpha Ken. It allowed us to reflect on times and ways that we have acted like those versions of man. But I don't think it tried to uplift us in any way, and I think that it should have. I believe that if you're going to tear someone down, it's your responsibility to give them ways they can build themselves back up. I'm a man, many of the people I most love in this world are men, and I believe it's in all of our best interests to figure out ways for the myriad varieties of men to channel themselves optimally. 

So since the movie didn't give us any leads, let's make our own: What are some archetypes that men can model themselves after that are strong, powerful, dignified, respectable, and an optimal use of our "god-given" traits (testosterone, logical function, etc.), that are at the same time positive towards others, constructive, productive, and generally a good thing for the people, the world, and the universe?

I'm grateful to be a part of this conversation, and I hope this dissection brought you closer to your goals! Thank God, long live democracy, and Barbie movie <em>highly</em> recommended. -- J.D.
