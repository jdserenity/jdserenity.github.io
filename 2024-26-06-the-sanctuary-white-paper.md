### The world needs a new direction. I aim to give it one.

At least I aim to give it an option.

In our modern multicultural societies. We’ve made a huge tradeoff. We’ve gained a rich cultural diversity that exemplifies tolerance and common decency, which is a beautiful achievement. But with it, comes a pervasive tension between groups, constant divisions between ourselves, and an ever present, ever growing threat of conflict, fuelled by hate for “the other”.

### But we’re all human, and there is no other. So why have we forgotten this in such a supposedly modern and sophisticated age?

The answer: lies in that one word that towers over so many others, morality. In my perception, I see the natural tendency for fragmentation playing out throughout our societies. People with the same backgrounds tend to stick together, people with the same beliefs tend to stick together, and people with the same shared history tend to stick together.

We would expect that after a sufficient period of time, differing groups would converge over their shared humanity and continued understanding of each other. But the reality is, that at the core of all belief systems, there are very important decisions made about morality. And when one group thinks the other is being sufficiently immoral (i.e. causing undue harm, disrespecting their perception of god, taking away the freedoms they previously were allowed, etc.), most people will not stand for such a thing.

Because morality also lies at the very thing that gives us any meaning in life, or any purpose for doing anything, this creates a dark abyss of conflict between groups. Each group must play out their moral code, or have no meaning. But one group’s moral code, will inevitably go strongly against another's.

### I believe that some of you will agree with this perception. And I hope that some of you will agree with my proposed solution.

Religion and philosophy are two sides of the same coin. Humanity’s quest to answer the most fundamental, most pressing, and most important questions that we are faced with in life. You know the ones. Because all humans are faced with these same questions, and no humans can function without satisfying answers to these questions, these questions must be answered. And every culture since the beginning of cultures has taken their best shot at it.

The result is that we now find ourselves with an extremely deep tapestry of every culture’s attempted answers. From heaven and hell, to nirvana, to void. 

### What should we do with our time? Well, there are many answers to that. What is good and what is evil? Well, it’s not that simple.

### With so many answers, and so many of them conflicting, we become lost. This happened to me, and it may have happened to you.

The thing is though, that the way truth works, is there can only be one of it. And although we may never find it, I believe we can find sufficient meaning in the everlasting pursuit of it. I think that that in itself is enough to keep us going, and to keep us all going, together. As a team. I dream of a world with no more warring factions. And No More Divisions.

The Sanctuary is a place where one can go to ask questions about these deepest of topics. It is a place where one can go to connect with others who also struggle with these questions. And it is a place where civil discourse between opposing viewpoints, will systematically, and finally, allow us to arrive where we need to be. Peace.

My first idea is that we can get together, maybe read from one of the many good religious or philosophical texts we can find, and then have a group discussion about what we learned, or what is on our minds, or whatever else. We can critically analyze ours and each other’s thoughts, and seek the truth together. Then we can have a brief session of being social to allow for companionship and bonds to be formed. 30 minutes for each thing, 1 hour and a half in total.

Maybe I’ll create a separate study group or what was commonly know as a “youth group” if enough people are interested and want to dive deep. 

Of course this is just my first proposal, and as we go along, with the help of all participants, we can change and improve things as we see fit. Slowly moving closer to our goal. And of course, Sunday has traditionally been a day for this sort of thing for some cultures, and within our own culture I think it serves as a good day as well.

I think that church as an institution served an incredible value that we have lost as a society, and that we need not believe in any current faith to be able to take part in that value. We can have a place of discussion, a place where people take shelter from the pain of life, and a place where people can form bonds with each other on the basis of their shared grappling with everything that it means to be alive.

So that being said: all are welcomed. The only way to get to the truth is to debate all possible perspectives. So Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, etc. All are welcomed here. Gays, straights, blacks, whites, “progressives”, “conservatives”, there are too many of us to list here. But. all. are. welcomed. here.

Just be prepared to have your opinions pushed back on and dissected. And be prepared to hear views about the world that may not be what you want to hear. They exist and the only way to improve them is to bring them to light. Just know that no falsehoods will be allowed to stand.

# DISCLAIMER: If anyone becomes physically violent you will be asked to leave. Only civil discourse is allowed.

My hope is not that this idea will be successful, and not even that this group will be successful. My hope is that others will be inspired by this experiment, learn from what we discover, and continue growing a movement towards unity, and towards peace. This may not be the best option that has ever existed or that will ever exist. It may even be a terrible idea. But at least it’s an idea, and unfortunately I don’t see very many of those right now.

The Sanctuary will be taking place every Sunday at 11am for 1 hour and a half. Join me if you like, it would be my pleasure.
